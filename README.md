# One-Loop calculation for gg -> W+ W- for small and large top quark masses

This is project from my bachelor thesis at the Institute of Theoretical Particle Physics at KIT (Karlsruhe Institut for Technology). It was written in Mathematica Language and calculates the Master Integrals in each case.

Note: In case of small top quark mass, boundary conditions has to be calculated. These were done by using the corresponding <em> Mellin-Barnes representation. </em>

To check out the physics behind the calculation, as well as fancy plots, take a look at the presentation file.
